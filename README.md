## Summary
Ohahu seems to be a very strong contender for a place with similar year-round temperatures. However, to make the best informed decision, it would be advisable to also take into consideration other important factors. 
### Other Considerations:
Climate-wise looking at percipitaiton throughout not only the year, but also the day, would be valuable. In tropical climates it is not uncommon to have multiple weather patterns in a single day, which could influence hours of operation. Outside of climate, it would be wise to review tourist traffic from a monthly perspective. If there are months that traffic is lighter, those may be good months to downscale and/or focus efforts on other areas of the business.
